These are my defaults for creating a new web app project:

- Codebase structure:  Modular monolith
- Folder structure:  Top level folders based on features / pages / domains, subfolders based on clean architecture-esque layers
- Hosting:  Vercel
- Language (frontend & backend):  Typescript
- Server runtime:  Node.js
- Web server framework:  Express.js
- Database:  Postgres
- Database hosting:  Neon or Supabase (Supabase if the DB is mostly auth, otherwise Neon)
- ORM:  Drizzle
- Frontend framework:  React
- Style framework:  Tailwind CSS
