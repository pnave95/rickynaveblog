# Welcome!

This is my first blog post on my new Astro-powered blog. This site is:

- **Fast**: Built with Astro for optimal performance
- **Simple**: Clean, minimal design focused on content
- **Interactive**: Comments powered by Giscus using GitHub Discussions

## Getting Started with Giscus

Comments are ready to use! You just need to configure them with your GitHub repository details.

See **GISCUS_SETUP.md** in the root directory for step-by-step instructions on:
1. Enabling GitHub Discussions on your repository
2. Installing the Giscus app
3. Getting your configuration values
4. Adding them to your blog

## What's Next?

You can create new blog posts by adding Markdown files to the `src/content/blog/` directory. Each post should have frontmatter with:

- `title`: The post title
- `description`: A short description (optional)
- `pubDate`: The publication date

Happy blogging!
