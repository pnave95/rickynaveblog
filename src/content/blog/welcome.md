# Welcome!

This is my first blog post on my new Astro-powered blog. This site is:

- **Fast**: Built with Astro for optimal performance
- **Simple**: Clean, minimal design focused on content
- **Interactive**: Comments powered by Giscus using GitHub Discussions

## Getting Started with Giscus

To enable comments on your blog posts, you'll need to:

1. Create a GitHub repository for your blog
2. Enable GitHub Discussions in your repository settings
3. Visit [giscus.app](https://giscus.app) to configure your settings
4. Update the Giscus component in `src/layouts/BlogPost.astro` with your repository details

## What's Next?

You can create new blog posts by adding Markdown files to the `src/content/blog/` directory. Each post should have frontmatter with:

- `title`: The post title
- `description`: A short description (optional)
- `pubDate`: The publication date

Happy blogging!
